# CR Helper - WhatsApp Lecture Alert using Google Classroom API

Recently, Google classroom was integrated with its own Google Meet, for the sole purpose of conducting online lectures and meetings. However, some professors (at least in my institute) prefer sharing a new link as an announcement in Classroom every time they have their lecture. While there is no issue with this process, most people are lazy to open up Google Classroom and join the particular meet everytime. Thus, the CRs (Class Reps) end up putting the Google Meet Link in WhatsApp for convenience. 

This Helper Application takes care of this entire thing. The Rep has to simply run the Python Code, click on the subject name and the app will take care of the rest. 

## Requirements

- Python FLASK
- GSuite
- [Google Classroom API Key from Google Cloud Services](https://cloud.google.com/)

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the Python FLASK Module.

```bash
pip install flask
```

## Usage

python main.py
```
